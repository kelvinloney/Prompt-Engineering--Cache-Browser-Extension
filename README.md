# Prompt Engineering: Cache Browser Extension

This template displays how I built a Chrome browser extension with GitHub Copilot - via Prompt Engineering.

To be clear, as a developer, Prompt Engineering involves **providing instructions or comments in the IDE to generate specific coding suggestions**.

These instructions or comments, otherwise known as Prompts, can be code blocks, individual lines of code, or natural language comments that I write to generate a specific suggestion from GitHub Copilot.

Using **React and Vite** via Prompt Engineering, I built the Chrome browser extension _Cache Chrome Extension_ that clears browser cache.

Below, you'll be able to see the Context and step-by-step Prompts that I used as well as the code generated to create the browser extension.

> How to use Vite to create a React app for a Chrome extension?

### STEP 1: File structure for a Chrome extension using React and Vite

### STEP 2: Configure the `manifest.json` file for a Chrome extension using React and Vite

### STEP 3: Set up a service worker in the `background.js` file to run in the background, perform tasks, and respond to user events outside of the popup

### STEP 4: Create a `popup.html` file that serves as the user interface for the extension

### STEP 5: Create a `popup.js` file that handles user interactions in the popup and communicates with the background service worker

### STEP 6: Style the popup using `styles.css`
